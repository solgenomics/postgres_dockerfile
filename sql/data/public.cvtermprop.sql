1	1	2	Derivation as a relation between instances. The temporal relation of derivation is more complex. Transformation, on the instance level, is just the relation of identity: each adult is identical to some child existing at some earlier time. Derivation on the instance-level is a relation holding between non-identicals. More precisely, it holds between distinct material continuants when one succeeds the other across a temporal divide in such a way that at least a biologically significant portion of the matter of the earlier continuant is inherited by the later. Thus we will have axioms to the effect that from c derives_from c1 we can infer that c and c1 are not identical and that there is some instant of time t such that c1 exists only prior to and c only subsequent to t. We will also be able to infer that the spatial region occupied by c as it begins to exist at t overlaps with the spatial region occupied by c1 as it ceases to exist in the same instant.	0

3	8	2	When an embryonic oenocyte (a type of insect cell) is transformed into a larval oenocyte, one and the same continuant entity preserves its identity while instantiating distinct classes at distinct times. The class-level relation transformation_of obtains between continuant classes C and C1 wherever each instance of the class C is such as to have existed at some earlier time as an instance of the distinct class C1 (see Figure 2 in paper). This relation is illustrated first of all at the molecular level of granularity by the relation between mature RNA and the pre-RNA from which it is processed, or between (UV-induced) thymine-dimer and thymine dinucleotide. At coarser levels of granularity it is illustrated by the transformations involved in the creation of red blood cells, for example, from reticulocyte to erythrocyte, and by processes of development, for example, from larva to pupa, or from (post-gastrular) embryo to fetus or from child to adult. It is also manifest in pathological transformations, for example, of normal colon into carcinomatous colon. In each such case, one and the same continuant entity instantiates distinct classes at different times in virtue of phenotypic changes.	0
4	9	2	Location as a relation between instances: The primitive instance-level relation c located_in r at t reflects the fact that each continuant is at any given time associated with exactly one spatial region, namely its exact location. Following we can use this relation to define a further instance-level location relation - not between a continuant and the region which it exactly occupies, but rather between one continuant and another. c is located in c1, in this sense, whenever the spatial region occupied by c is part_of the spatial region occupied by c1.    Note that this relation comprehends both the relation of exact location between one continuant and another which obtains when r and r1 are identical (for example, when a portion of fluid exactly fills a cavity), as well as those sorts of inexact location relations which obtain, for example, between brain and head or between ovum and uterus	0

7	13	2	OBSOLETE. The definition is "As for part_of, with the additional constraint that subject and object may be identical". However, part_of is already reflexive, therefore improper_part_of is identical to part_of. If read differently, as "improper_part_of is part_of but not proper_part_of",improper_part_of becomes identity. So, improper_part_of is either identical to part_of or to identity, and not an intuitive synonym for either of them. [Robert Hoehndorf]	0
8	15	2	Parthood as a relation between instances: The primitive instance-level relation p part_of p1 is illustrated in assertions such as: this instance of rhodopsin mediated phototransduction part_of this instance of visual perception.    This relation satisfies at least the following standard axioms of mereology: reflexivity (for all p, p part_of p); anti-symmetry (for all p, p1, if p part_of p1 and p1 part_of p then p and p1 are identical); and transitivity (for all p, p1, p2, if p part_of p1 and p1 part_of p2, then p part_of p2). Analogous axioms hold also for parthood as a relation between spatial regions.    For parthood as a relation between continuants, these axioms need to be modified to take account of the incorporation of a temporal argument. Thus for example the axiom of transitivity for continuants will assert that if c part_of c1 at t and c1 part_of c2 at t, then also c part_of c2 at t.    Parthood as a relation between classes: To define part_of as a relation between classes we again need to distinguish the two cases of continuants and processes, even though the explicit reference to instants of time now falls away. For continuants, we have C part_of C1 if and only if any instance of C at any time is an instance-level part of some instance of C1 at that time, as for example in: cell nucleus part_ of cell.	0

11	22	2	An example is: translation preceded_by transcription; aging preceded_by development (not however death preceded_by aging). Where derives_from links classes of continuants, preceded_by links classes of processes. Clearly, however, these two relations are not independent of each other. Thus if cells of type C1 derive_from cells of type C, then any cell division involving an instance of C1 in a given lineage is preceded_by cellular processes involving an instance of C.    The assertion P preceded_by P1 tells us something about Ps in general: that is, it tells us something about what happened earlier, given what we know about what happened later. Thus it does not provide information pointing in the opposite direction, concerning instances of P1 in general; that is, that each is such as to be succeeded by some instance of P. Note that an assertion to the effect that P preceded_by P1 is rather weak; it tells us little about the relations between the underlying instances in virtue of which the preceded_by relation obtains. Typically we will be interested in stronger relations, for example in the relation immediately_preceded_by, or in relations which combine preceded_by with a condition to the effect that the corresponding instances of P and P1 share participants, or that their participants are connected by relations of derivation, or (as a first step along the road to a treatment of causality) that the one process in some way affects (for example, initiates or regulates) the other.	0
12	24	2	Has_participant is a primitive instance-level relation between a process, a continuant, and a time at which the continuant participates in some way in the process. The relation obtains, for example, when this particular process of oxygen exchange across this particular alveolar membrane has_participant this particular sample of hemoglobin at this particular time.	0

13	25	2	Containment obtains in each case between material and immaterial continuants, for instance: lung contained_in thoracic cavity; bladder contained_in pelvic cavity. Hence containment is not a transitive relation.    If c part_of c1 at t then we have also, by our definition and by the axioms of mereology applied to spatial regions, c located_in c1 at t. Thus, many examples of instance-level location relations for continuants are in fact cases of instance-level parthood. For material continuants location and parthood coincide. Containment is location not involving parthood, and arises only where some immaterial continuant is involved. To understand this relation, we first define overlap for continuants as follows:    c1 overlap c2 at t =def for some c, c part_of c1 at t and c part_of c2 at t. The containment relation on the instance level can then be defined (see definition):	0
14	27	2	Note that adjacent_to as thus defined is not a symmetric relation, in contrast to its instance-level counterpart. For it can be the case that Cs are in general such as to be adjacent to instances of C1 while no analogous statement holds for C1s in general in relation to instances of C. Examples are: nuclear membrane adjacent_to cytoplasm; seminal vesicle adjacent_to urinary bladder; ovary adjacent_to parietal pelvic peritoneum	0

5174	56154	2	This term was obsoleted because it is essentially identical to a Process term (specifically the Biological Process term which has been selected as a term to consider for reannotation), i.e. it is defined only in terms of the process it acts in and it does NOT convey any information about the molecular nature of the function or whether the function is based on binding DNA, on interacting with other proteins, or some other mechanism. To transfer all annotations without review, the BP term indicated is considered to be equivalent and thus the only appropriate destination for all annotations. To reannotate to a MF term, you will probably need to revisit the original literature or other primary data because this "MF" term was not defined in terms of mechanism of action and there are multiple possibilities in the revised MF structure. In reannotation, please also consider descendent terms of the suggested MF terms as a more specific term may be more appropriate than the MF terms indicated. Please be aware that you may wish to request a new term if the mechanism of action of this gene product is not yet represented or if you are annotating for an RNAP different than one for which there is a specific suggested term. Also note that if there is no information about how the gene product acts, it may be appropriate to annotate to the root term for molecular_function.	0

Thus, terms trying to distinguish "general/nonspecific/basal" transcription from "specific" transcription were removed from both the Molecular Function and the Biological Process ontologies. In addition, this Molecular Function term was defined only in terms of the process it acts in and it does NOT convey any information about the molecular nature of the function or whether the function is based on binding DNA, on interacting with other proteins, or some other mechanism. To transfer all annotations without review, the BP term indicated is considered to be equivalent and thus the only appropriate destination for all annotations. To reannotate to a MF term, you will probably need to revisit the original literature or other primary data because this "MF" term was not defined in terms of mechanism of action and there are multiple possibilities in the revised MF structure. In reannotation, please also consider descendent terms of the suggested MF terms as a more specific term may be more appropriate than the MF terms indicated. Please be aware that you may wish to request a new term if the mechanism of action of your repressor is not yet represented or if you are annotating for an RNAP different than one for which there is a specific suggested term. Also note that if there is no information about how the gene product acts, it may be appropriate to annotate to the root term for molecular_function.	0

5239	56722	2	The word "promoter" is used variously in the literature to describe the core promoter specifically or the entire proximal regulatory region (excluding any distal enhancers) including both the core promoter and the upstream region where activating transcription factors such as Gal4 in S. cerevisiae or catabolite activator protein (CAP) in E. coli bind. To minimize ambiguity in the use of the word "promoter" in GO, we have chosen the phrase "transcription regulatory region" in order to refer to all of the regulatory regions. Regulatory regions in the DNA which control initiation may include the "core promoter" where the basal transcription machinery binds, the "core promoter proximal region" where regulatory factors other than the basal machinery bind, and "enhancer" regions which are typically more distal from the core promoter. There are also additional regulatory regions, in both the DNA and the RNA transcript, which regulate elongation or termination of transcription. ANNOTATION NOTE: Regarding annotation to "transcription regulatory region DNA binding" (GO:0044212) and any of its is_a children, note that annotation to these terms specifies DNA binding only without any statement about transcription factor activity. To make an annotation about a function of transcription factor activity, consider "sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factor activity" (GO:0003700) or its is_a children which have has_part relationships to the appropriate kind of "transcription regulatory region DNA binding".	0

5331	57390	2	This term was obsoleted because it is essentially identical to a Process term (specifically the Biological Process term which has been selected as a term to consider for reannotation), i.e. it is defined only in terms of the process it acts in and it does NOT convey any information about the molecular nature of the function or whether the function is based on binding DNA, on interacting with other proteins, or some other mechanism. To transfer all annotations without review, the BP term indicated is considered to be equivalent and thus the only appropriate destination for all annotations. To reannotate to a MF term, you will probably need to revisit the original literature or other primary data because this "MF" term was not defined in terms of mechanism of action and there are multiple possibilities in the revised MF structure.

5367	57638	2	This term was obsoleted because "general/nonspecific/basal" transcription vs "specific" transcription were determined not to be separable, distinct process. Thus, terms trying to distinguish "general/nonspecific/basal" transcription from "specific" transcription were removed from both the Molecular Function and the Biological Process ontologies. In addition, this Molecular Function term was defined only in terms of the process it acts in and it does NOT convey any information about the molecular nature of the function or whether the function is based on binding DNA, on interacting with other proteins, or some other mechanism.

5382	57773	2	The word "promoter" is used variously in the literature to describe the core promoter specifically or the entire proximal regulatory region (excluding any distal enhancers) including both the core promoter and the upstream region where activating transcription factors such as Gal4 in S. cerevisiae or catabolite activator protein (CAP) in E. coli bind. To minimize ambiguity in the use of the word "promoter" in GO, we have chosen the phrase "transcription regulatory region" in order to refer to all of the regulatory regions. Regulatory regions in the DNA which control initiation may include the "core promoter" where the basal transcription machinery binds, the "core promoter proximal region" where regulatory factors other than the basal machinery bind, and "enhancer" regions which are typically more distal from the core promoter. There are also additional regulatory regions, in both the DNA and the RNA transcript, which regulate elongation or termination of transcription. ANNOTATION NOTE: Regarding annotation to "transcription regulatory region DNA binding" (GO:0044212) and any of its is_a children, note that annotation to these terms specifies DNA binding only without any statement about transcription factor activity. To make an annotation about a function of transcription factor activity, consider "sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factor activity" (GO:0003700) or its is_a children which have has_part relationships to the appropriate kind of "transcription regulatory region DNA binding".	0

5391	57823	2	This term was made obsolete because it represents a regulator of non-existent molecular function.	0
5392	57829	2	This term was made obsolete because the activity it describes does not exist, and the gene product with the name 'polyketide synthase' has multiple functional domains, so using the name to describe a single function would be misleading.	0
5393	57834	2	Note that the enzyme alcohol oxidase also has methanol oxidase activity (GO:0046563).	0
5394	57838	2	Note that with respect to annotation, "base pairing with RNA" and its child terms are intended to be used to annotate the activity of gene products composed of nucleic acid, presumably RNA, to interact with other RNA molecules via base pairing.

5414	57979	2	This is based on the finding that L-aspartate oxidase (NadB) of E. coli preferentially uses fumarate as the electron acceptor and does so under anaerobic conditions. The same enzyme uses oxygen as the electron acceptor under aerobic conditions. The EC conflates the two reactions in EC 1.4.3.16 (as they are catalyzed by the same enzyme).	0

5429	58077	2	Note that distal enhancers of the type found in mammalian cells are not known to occur in either Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Schizosaccharomyces pombe. While some S. cerevisiae literature does refer to sequences distal to the initiation site, these distal sites do not seem to function independently of position or orientation as mammalian distal enhancers do and are not considered to be enhancers.	0

5474	58419	2	This term was obsoleted because it is essentially identical to a Process term (specifically the Biological Process term which has been selected as a term to consider for reannotation), i.e. it is defined only in terms of the process it acts in and it does NOT convey any information about the molecular nature of the function or whether the function is based on binding DNA, on interacting with other proteins, or some other mechanism. To transfer all annotations without review, the BP term indicated is considered to be equivalent and thus the only appropriate destination for all annotations. To reannotate to a MF term, you will probably need to revisit the original literature or other primary data because this "MF" term was not defined in terms of mechanism of action and there are multiple possibilities in the revised MF structure. In reannotation, please also consider descendent terms of the suggested MF terms as a more specific term may be more appropriate than the MF terms indicated.

5560	59059	2	The word "promoter" is used variously in the literature to describe the core promoter specifically or the entire proximal regulatory region (excluding any distal enhancers) including both the core promoter and the upstream region where activating transcription factors such as Gal4 in S. cerevisiae or catabolite activator protein (CAP) in E. coli bind. To minimize ambiguity in the use of the word "promoter" in GO, we have chosen the phrase "transcription regulatory region" in order to refer to all of the regulatory regions. Regulatory regions in the DNA which control initiation may include the "core promoter" where the basal transcription machinery binds, the "core promoter proximal region" where regulatory factors other than the basal machinery bind, and "enhancer" regions which are typically more distal from the core promoter. There are also additional regulatory regions, in both the DNA and the RNA transcript, which regulate elongation or termination of transcription. ANNOTATION NOTE: Regarding annotation to "transcription regulatory region DNA binding" (GO:0044212) and any of its is_a children, note that annotation to these terms specifies DNA binding only without any statement about transcription factor activity. To make an annotation about a function of transcription factor activity, consider "sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factor activity" (GO:0003700) or its is_a children which have has_part relationships to the appropriate kind of "transcription regulatory region DNA binding".	0

5664	59827	2	This term was obsoleted because it is essentially identical to a Process term (specifically the Biological Process term which has been selected as a term to consider for reannotation), i.e. it is defined only in terms of the process it acts in and it does NOT convey any information about the molecular nature of the function or whether the function is based on binding DNA, on interacting with other proteins, or some other mechanism. To transfer all annotations without review, the BP term indicated is considered to be equivalent and thus the only appropriate destination for all annotations. To reannotate to a MF term, you will probably need to revisit the original literature or other primary data because this "MF" term was not defined in terms of mechanism of action and there are multiple possibilities in the revised MF structure.

Site-specific recombinases perform a more complex reaction in which four strands are broken and subsequently joined to a different DNA duplex, resulting in the production of a recombinant product. The telomere resolvases on the other hand, must break two phosphodiester bonds in a single DNA duplex (one on each strand) and join each end with the opposite DNA strand to form covalently closed hairpin telomeres.	0

5767	60557	2	The word "promoter" is used variously in the literature to describe the core promoter specifically or the entire proximal regulatory region (excluding any distal enhancers) including both the core promoter and the upstream region where activating transcription factors such as Gal4 in S. cerevisiae or catabolite activator protein (CAP) in E. coli bind. To minimize ambiguity in the use of the word "promoter" in GO, we have chosen the phrase "transcription regulatory region" in order to refer to all of the regulatory regions. Regulatory regions in the DNA which control initiation may include the "core promoter" where the basal transcription machinery binds, the "core promoter proximal region" where regulatory factors other than the basal machinery bind, and "enhancer" regions which are typically more distal from the core promoter. There are also additional regulatory regions, in both the DNA and the RNA transcript, which regulate elongation or termination of transcription. ANNOTATION NOTE: Regarding annotation to "transcription regulatory region DNA binding" (GO:0044212) and any of its is_a children, note that annotation to these terms specifies DNA binding only without any statement about transcription factor activity. To make an annotation about a function of transcription factor activity, consider "sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factor activity" (GO:0003700) or its is_a children which have has_part relationships to the appropriate kind of "transcription regulatory region DNA binding".	0

5914	61553	2	The word "promoter" is used variously in the literature to describe the core promoter specifically or the entire proximal regulatory region (excluding any distal enhancers) including both the core promoter and the upstream region where activating transcription factors such as Gal4 in S. cerevisiae or catabolite activator protein (CAP) in E. coli bind. To minimize ambiguity in the use of the word "promoter" in GO, we have chosen the phrase "transcription regulatory region" in order to refer to all of the regulatory regions. Regulatory regions in the DNA which control initiation may include the "core promoter" where the basal transcription machinery binds, the "core promoter proximal region" where regulatory factors other than the basal machinery bind, and "enhancer" regions which are typically more distal from the core promoter. There are also additional regulatory regions, in both the DNA and the RNA transcript, which regulate elongation or termination of transcription. ANNOTATION NOTE: Regarding annotation to "transcription regulatory region DNA binding" (GO:0044212) and any of its is_a children, note that annotation to these terms specifies DNA binding only without any statement about transcription factor activity. To make an annotation about a function of transcription factor activity, consider "sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factor activity" (GO:0003700) or its is_a children which have has_part relationships to the appropriate kind of "transcription regulatory region DNA binding".	0

5916	61585	2	Note that enzymes classified as EC:1.1.5.3 have several activities. They should be annotated with the terms GO:0004368, GO:0052590 and GO:0052591.	0
5917	61589	2	This term was made obsolete because it refers to a non-existent molecular function term, 'calmodulin activity'.	0
5918	61591	2	This term was made obsolete because it represents a gene product.	0
5919	61592	2	This term was made obsolete because 'signal peptide' is difficult to define unambiguously, and because the term refers to gene products.	0
5920	61595	2	This term was obsoleted because it is essentially identical to a Process term (specifically the Biological Process term which has been selected as a term to consider for reannotation), i.e. it is defined only in terms of the process it acts in and it does NOT convey any information about the molecular nature of the function or whether the function is based on binding DNA, on interacting with other proteins, or some other mechanism. To transfer all annotations without review, the BP term indicated is considered to be equivalent and thus the only appropriate destination for all annotations. To reannotate to a MF term, you will probably need to revisit the original literature or other primary data because this "MF" term was not defined in terms of mechanism of action and there are multiple possibilities in the revised MF structure. In reannotation, please also consider descendent terms of the suggested MF terms as a more specific term may be more appropriate than the MF terms indicated. Please be aware that you may wish to request a new term if the mechanism of action of this gene product is not yet represented or if you are annotating for an RNAP different than one for which there is a specific suggested term. Also note that if there is no information about how the gene product acts, it may be appropriate to annotate to the root term for molecular_function.	0
5921	61603	2	Note that this term represents an activity and not a gene product, and should only be used when the receptor binds the ligand activin. For binding to other extracellular ligands, consider annotating to terms under 'transmembrane signaling receptor activity ; GO:0004888.	0

5924	61631	2	This term was made obsolete because it is a redundant grouping term with only one child.	0
5925	61647	2	Note that some gene products that possess DNA translocase activity, such as members of the FtsK/SpoIIIE family, can be fixed in place by interactions with other components of the cell; the relative movement between the protein and DNA bound to it results in movement of the DNA within the cell, often across a membrane.	0
5926	61650	2	Note that this term and its child terms are intended for receptors that are directly coupled to a signal transduction pathway. This term should therefore not be used to annotate decoy receptors and other proteins that bind a signal but do not pass the signal on. For receptors that mediate transport of a substance into the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis, consider instead the term 'cargo receptor activity ; GO:0038024' and its children.	0

5983	62013	2	Note that in the standard genetic code, ATT codes for isoleucine.	0
5984	62014	2	This term was made obsolete because the word "promoter" is used ambiguously in the literature. It sometimes is used to refer specifically to the "core promoter" region recognized by the basal transcription machinery, and other times is used to refer to a larger regulatory region composed of the core promoter and also the regulatory region adjacent (proximal) to the core promoter. The core promoter proximal region is typically recognized by "regulatory transcription factors", such as Gal4 in S. cerevisiae.	0

6099	62980	2	This term was made obsolete because it represents a gene product.	0
6100	62983	2	This term was obsoleted because it is essentially identical to a Process term (specifically the Biological Process term which has been selected as a term to consider for reannotation), i.e. it is defined only in terms of the process it acts in and it does NOT convey any information about the molecular nature of the function or whether the function is based on binding DNA, on interacting with other proteins, or some other mechanism. To transfer all annotations without review, the BP term indicated is considered to be equivalent and thus the only appropriate destination for all annotations. To reannotate to a MF term, you will probably need to revisit the original literature or other primary data because this "MF" term was not defined in terms of mechanism of action and there are multiple possibilities in the revised MF structure. In reannotation, please also consider descendent terms of the suggested MF terms as a more specific term may be more appropriate than the MF terms indicated. Please be aware that you may wish to request a new term if the mechanism of action of this gene product is not yet represented or if you are annotating for an RNAP different than one for which there is a specific suggested term. Also note that if there is no information about how the gene product acts, it may be appropriate to annotate to the root term for molecular_function.	0
6101	62986	2	Note that this function was formerly EC:4.1.3.9.	0
6102	63006	2	Note that the phrase "upstream activating sequence", or UAS is often used in S. cerevisiae literature to refer to regulatory sequences that occur in the region upstream and proximal to the core promoter.

6115	63122	2	Note that in the standard genetic code, GAT codes for aspartic acid.	0
6116	63128	2	Note that the polyprenyl sidechain substrate for these methyltransferases varies in length between species, for example, 6 units in S. cerevisiae, 8 units in E. coli and 10 units in G. suboxidans. Where the length of the substrate polyprenyl chain is unknown, the term '2-polyprenyl-6-methoxy-1,4-benzoquinone methyltransferase activity ; GO:0008425' should be used.	0

6172	63540	2	Note that the enzyme performing this function has only recently been characterized, and not completely (see PMID:11818558). The common and systematic names have been suggested by TIGR, who have recently compiled an HMM model for this gene (TIGR00216). The enzyme appears to catalyze the final step in the non-mevalonate terpene biosynthesis pathway. Its two products, isopentenyl pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate, are apparently generated from a common intermediate formed by the enzyme. The mechanism and identity of the reductant have not yet been determined.	0

6179	63596	2	The word "promoter" is used variously in the literature to describe the core promoter specifically or the entire proximal regulatory region (excluding any distal enhancers) including both the core promoter and the upstream region where activating transcription factors such as Gal4 in S. cerevisiae or catabolite activator protein (CAP) in E. coli bind. To minimize ambiguity in the use of the word "promoter" in GO, we have chosen the phrase "transcription regulatory region" in order to refer to all of the regulatory regions. Regulatory regions in the DNA which control initiation may include the "core promoter" where the basal transcription machinery binds, the "core promoter proximal region" where regulatory factors other than the basal machinery bind, and "enhancer" regions which are typically more distal from the core promoter. There are also additional regulatory regions, in both the DNA and the RNA transcript, which regulate elongation or termination of transcription. ANNOTATION NOTE: Regarding annotation to "transcription regulatory region DNA binding" (GO:0044212) and any of its is_a children, note that annotation to these terms specifies DNA binding only without any statement about transcription factor activity. To make an annotation about a function of transcription factor activity, consider "sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factor activity" (GO:0003700) or its is_a children which have has_part relationships to the appropriate kind of "transcription regulatory region DNA binding".	0

6184	63616	2	This term was obsoleted because it is essentially identical to a Process term (specifically the Biological Process term which has been selected as a term to consider for reannotation), i.e. it is defined only in terms of the process it acts in and it does NOT convey any information about the molecular nature of the function or whether the function is based on binding DNA, on interacting with other proteins, or some other mechanism. To transfer all annotations without review, the BP term indicated is considered to be equivalent and thus the only appropriate destination for all annotations. To reannotate to a MF term, you will probably need to revisit the original literature or other primary data because this "MF" term was not defined in terms of mechanism of action and there are multiple possibilities in the revised MF structure. In reannotation, please also consider descendent terms of the suggested MF terms as a more specific term may be more appropriate than the MF terms indicated. Please be aware that you may wish to request a new term if the mechanism of action of this gene product is not yet represented or if you are annotating for an RNAP different than one for which there is a specific suggested term. Also note that if there is no information about how the gene product acts, it may be appropriate to annotate to the root term for molecular_function.	0

To transfer all annotations without review, the BP term indicated is considered to be equivalent and thus the only appropriate destination for all annotations. To reannotate to a MF term, you will probably need to revisit the original literature or other primary data because this "MF" term was not defined in terms of mechanism of action and there are multiple possibilities in the revised MF structure. In reannotation, please also consider descendent terms of the suggested MF terms as a more specific term may be more appropriate than the MF terms indicated. Please be aware that you may wish to request a new term if the mechanism of action of this gene product is not yet represented or if you are annotating for an RNAP different than one for which there is a specific suggested term. Also note that if there is no information about how the gene product acts, it may be appropriate to annotate to the root term for molecular_function.	0

6674	67746	2	Note that the gene/protein name 'APC' should not be confused with the abbreviation for 'anaphase promoting complex'.	0
6675	67762	2	This term was made obsolete because its position and synonym implied that it confused a coated vesicle with the coat itself.	0
6676	67766	2	Note that this term refers to disrupted cells, and does not necessarily correspond to any specific structure(s) in an intact cell.	0
6677	67783	2	Note that the term name uses Saccharomyces gene product names because no other names have yet arisen for this complex; the term nevertheless can be used for analogous complexes in other eukaryotes, and the name can be changed if better wording is found.	0
6678	67796	2	See also the molecular function term 'guanylate cyclase activity ; GO:0004383'.	0
6679	67801	2	Note that this term does not have a relationship to 'vacuole ; GO:0005773' because it does not fit the definition of a vacuole; the parasitophorous vacuole was so named because it resembles a vacuole in the microscope.	0
6680	67802	2	Note that this term can be used in place of the obsolete cellular component term 'telomere ; GO:0005696'. Use with caution because this term refers to a specific region of the chromosome and not a protein complex.	0

6687	67864	2	Note that this complex is conserved in fungi but has not been observed in metazoans.	0
6688	67868	2	This term was made obsolete because it was originally intended only as a temporary parent for protein complex terms for which no more specific parents had been found. This term no longer has any children: All protein complex terms are is_a 'protein complex ; GO:0043234' and nearly all have been placed under parents to yield more specific paths traversing a part_of relationship. In other words, the term has been superseded by other terms and relationships in the cellular component ontology, and is no longer needed.	0

Note that IgNAR is found in serum of cartilaginous fish as a heavy chain dimer without immunoglobulin light chains. Note that HCab is found in camels as a heavy chain dimer without immunoglobulin light chains.	0
6719	68056	2	This term was made obsolete because prior to cleavage, complement component C2 is a single polypeptide rather than a complex, and after cleavage the products do not remain physically associated; there is thus no known biological entity corresponding to "complement C2 complex".	0
6720	68061	2	This term was made obsolete because it refers to two distinct complexes, PCNA and Replication factor C (RFC), the latter of which is already represented as a separate, unrelated GO term (DNA replication factor C complex ; GO:0005663). In addition, the phrase 'delta-DNA polymerase cofactor' to represent both PCNA and RFC is not used in current literature.	0
6721	68072	2	This term was made obsolete because it is based on a temporal division of the cell cycle.	0
6722	68073	2	Note that this term refers to a subcellular structure, and should not be confused with the specialized cells known as xanthophores, which produce yellow pigment and are found in fish and amphibian skin.

6735	68157	2	This term was made obsolete because it represents a single gene product and not a complex.	0
6736	68168	2	Note that the Golgi apparatus can be located in various places in the cytoplasm. In plants and lower animal cells, the Golgi apparatus exists as many copies of discrete stacks dispersed throughout the cytoplasm, while the Golgi apparatus of interphase mammalian cells is a juxtanuclear, often pericentriolar reticulum, where the discrete Golgi stacks are stitched together to form a compact and interconnected ribbon, sometimes called the Golgi ribbon.	0
6737	68170	2	Note that this term represents a location, not a function; the activity possessed by this complex is mentioned in the definition for the purpose of describing and distinguishing the complex.

6741	68211	2	See also the cellular component term 'MHC class I peptide loading complex ; GO:0042824'.	0
6742	68222	2	This term was made obsolete because 'repairosome' has fallen out of use in the literature, and the large complex described in the definition has not been confirmed to exist. The term has also confused annotators.	0
6743	68232	2	Note that this term refers to disrupted cells, and does not necessarily correspond to any specific structure(s) in an intact cell.	0
6744	68234	2	This term was made obsolete because dihydrolipoamide S-succinyltransferase itself is not a complex, it is a component of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, the activity dihydrolipoamide S-succinyltransferase is contained in a single polypeptide.	0
6745	68237	2	This term was made obsolete because more specific terms were created.	0

7620	72484	2	Example: [E=organism Q=lacks_all_parts_of_type E2=Wing] - applies to an organism. A relational quality in which the bearer entity has no parts of the specified type. The bearer of this quality has_part = 0 of the indicated entity type, where a comparable organism usually has at least 1 part of the same type. Note that the bearer of the quality is the whole, not the part. Formally: If a bearer entity e lacks all parts of type X at time t, then there exists no instances x of X at t such that x part_of e that has no wings, where wings are normally present in that organism type. In OWL this is equivalent to a restriction on the OBO_REL:has_part relation with cardinality=0, i.e has_part 0 E2.	0

7648	73259	2	Shapes are invariant on size transformations. Shapes can be subdivided into 2D and 3D shapes, We can also make a distinction between shapes of complete self-connected objects, and shapes of parts of objects.	0
7649	73270	2	Example: [ E=wing Q=absent ] -applies to an organism that lacks wings. Note that this is the reciprocal quality to the relational quality "lacks all parts of type". This means that [E=wing Q=absent] is replaceable with [E=organism Q=lacks_all_parts_of_type E2=Wing]. The latter is preferable as it allows greater precision in stating what is lacking from where. E.g. We can say [E=spermatocyte Q=lacks_all_parts_of_type E2=aster] to describe spermatocytes that have no asters.	0

7661	73557	2	Relational qualities are qualities that hold between multiple entities. Normal (monadic) qualities such as the shape of a eyeball exist purely as a quality of that eyeball. A relational quality such as sensitivity to light is a quality of that eyeball (and connecting nervous system) as it relates to incoming light waves/particles.	0

8015	76006	2	The type of RNA editing found in the mitochondria of Myxomycota, characterized by the insertion of mono- and dinucleotides in RNAs relative to their mtDNA template and in addition, C to U base conversion. The most common mononucleotide insertion is cytidine, although a number of uridine mononucleotides are inserted at specific sites. Adenine and guanine have not been observed in mononucleotide insertions. Five different dinucleotide insertions have been observed, GC, GU, CU, AU and AA. Both mono- and dinucleotide insertions create open reading frames in mRNA and contribute to highly conserved structural features of rRNAs and tRNAs.	0
